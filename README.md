# Movie-Recommendation-System
THERE ARE COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS-

  1.Demographic Filtering -It offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre.
                       #  The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. 
                       #  Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple.
                       #  The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and
                       #  critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.
  2.Content Based Filtering - It suggest similar items based on a particular item. 
                       # This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. 
                       # The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, 
                       # he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.
